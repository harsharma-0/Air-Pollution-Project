# 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
The data is loaded using pd.read_csv().
Basic exploration is performed using df.head(), df.shape, df.info(), df.isnull().sum(), df.describe(), and df.nunique().
# 2. Data Visualization:
Visualizations include pair plots, histograms, and bar plots using seaborn and matplotlib to explore the distribution of air quality data across different states and pollutants (e.g., SO2, NO2, RSPM, SPM).
# 3. Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values by filling in modes for categorical columns and zeros for numerical columns.
Dropping unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
Feature engineering by calculating individual pollutant indices (SOi, Noi, Rpi, SPMi) using custom functions.
# 4. Air Quality Index (AQI) Calculation:
An overall AQI is calculated using the pollutant indices to classify air quality into categories such as "Good," "Moderate," "Poor," etc.
# 5. Regression Modeling:
Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor are applied to predict AQI.
The models are evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared values on both training and test datasets.
# 6. Classification Modeling:
The AQI is categorized into ranges, and classification models are applied, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Model evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, F-beta score, and Cohen's Kappa score.
# 7. Model Predictions:
Predictions are made using the trained models, and the results are printed to assess performance.
## Suggestions for Improvement:
### Hyperparameter Tuning:

Implement grid search or random search to optimize model hyperparameters, especially for the Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
### Cross-Validation:

Use cross-validation (e.g., k-fold) to get a more reliable estimate of model performance.
### Feature Scaling:

Consider feature scaling (e.g., standardization) before applying certain models like KNN or Logistic Regression to improve performance.
### Handling Class Imbalance:

If thereâ€™s a class imbalance in the AQI ranges, consider techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights to address it.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Further EDA can be done to understand the relationships between features and target variables.
